    content: `Freedom or jail, clip's inserted, a baby's being born
    Same time a man is murdered, the beginning and end
    As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
    My plateau, and also, what defines my name
    First it was Nasty, but times have changed
    Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain
    I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
    Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
    Saw my close friends shot, flatline am I sane?
    That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim
    On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
    Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
    Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
    To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
    To the big dogs living large, taking in light
    Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
    Is what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
    Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
    Heaven and hell, rap legend, presence is felt
    And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell
    NAS, NAS
    "Nas is like" Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
    Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
    Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
    Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
    "Nas is like" Iron Mike, messiah type
    Before the Christ, after the death
    The last one left, let my cash invest in stock
    Came a along way from blasting, tecs on blocks
    Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
    From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
    Dimes, giving fellatio, siete zeros
    Bet my nine spit for the pesos
    But what's it all worth, can't take it with you under this Earth
    Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
    They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
    Before my number's called, history's made
    Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
    Making choices, that determine my future under the sky
    To rob steal or kill, I'm wondering why
    It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
    Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
    Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is
    "Nas is like" Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
    I'm like beef, bustin' heat through your windows
    I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
    Like Greeks in Egypt, learning somethin deep from they teachers
    I'm like crime, like your nine, your man you would die for
    Always got you, I'm like Pac dude you would cry for
    I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
    Corporate accounts from a rich company
    I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races
    Combined in one man, like the '99 summer jam
    Bulletproof Hummer man
    I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
    I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
    I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
    Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
    Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it your system every night`,

    content: `I'm about to lose my mind
    You've been gone for so long
    I'm runnin' out of time
    I need a doctor, call me a doctor
    I need a doctor, doctor
    To bring me back to life
    I told the world, one day I would pay it back
    Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
    So that one day I could play it back
    But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
    Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black
    Hope, I just need a ray of that
    'Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for 'em
    They just say it's wack, but they don't know what dope is
    And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
    All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
    You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
    But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
    But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
    It's dark, let me turn on the lights
    And brighten me and enlighten you
    I don't think you realise what you mean to me
    Not the slightest clue, 'cause me and you were like a crew
    I was like your sidekick, you gon' either wanna fight
    When I get off this fuckin' mic, or you gon' hug me
    But I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do 'cause
    I'm about to lose my mind
    You've been gone for so long
    I'm runnin' out of time
    I need a doctor, call me a doctor
    I need a doctor, doctor
    To bring me back to life
    It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
    You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
    'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
    But you're either gettin' lazy
    Or you don't believe in you no more
    Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
    Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
    Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
    Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
    I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
    It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
    Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth!
    You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
    Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
    Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
    You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
    But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
    But I ain't givin' up faith
    And you ain't givin' up on me, get up, Dre!
    I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck's sake!
    I'm about to lose my mind
    You've been gone for so long
    I'm runnin' out of time
    I need a doctor, call me a doctor
    I need a doctor, doctor
    To bring me back to life
    Bring me back to life
    Bring me back to life
    (I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life)
    It literally feels like a lifetime ago
    But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
    You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
    Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
    Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
    They said they was ridin' to the death
    But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
    I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
    Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him
    Fuckin' backstabbers!
    When the chips were down you just laughed at us
    Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
    You gon' see us in our lab jackets
    And ask us where the fuck we been?
    You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
    And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
    Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back, bastards!
    One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags, and as
    I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream
    "Dre, don't leave us like that, man!" 'cause
    I'm about to lose my mind
    You've been gone for so long
    I'm runnin' out of time
    I need a doctor, call me a doctor
    I need a doctor, doctor
    To bring me back to life`,

    Got out of bed at all
    The morning rain clouds up my window
    And I can't see at all
    And even if I could it'll all be gray
    But your picture on my wall
    It reminds me, that it's not so bad
    It's not so bad
    My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
    Got out of bed at all
    The morning rain clouds up my window (window)
    And I can't see at all
    And even if I could it'll all be gray
    But your picture on my wall
    It reminds me, that it's not so bad
    It's not so bad
    Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
    I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
    I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
    There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
    Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
    But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
    My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
    If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
    I'ma name her Bonnie
    I read about your uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
    I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
    I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
    I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
    I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
    I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
    Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
    Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
    This is Stan
    My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
    Got out of bed at all
    The morning rain clouds up my window (window)
    And I can't see at all
    And even if I could it'll all be gray
    But your picture on my wall
    It reminds me, that it's not so bad
    It's not so bad
    Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
    I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
    If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
    You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
    That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
    We waited in the blistering cold for you
    For four hours and you just said, "No"
    That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
    He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
    I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
    Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
    See, I'm just like you in a way
    I never knew my father neither
    He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
    I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
    So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
    'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
    I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
    Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
    It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
    See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
    My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
    But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
    She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me, man
    I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
    Sincerely yours, Stan
    P.S. we should be together too
    My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
    Got out of bed at all
    The morning rain clouds up my window (window)

    And even if I could it'll all be gray

    It reminds me, that it's not so bad
    It's not so bad
    Dear Mr. I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans
    This will be the last package I ever send your ass
    It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
    I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
    So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
    I'm in the car right now, I'm doing ninety on the freeway
    Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
    You dare me to drive?
    You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
    About that guy who could have saved that other guy from drowning
    But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
    That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
    Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
    And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
    I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
    I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
    You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
    And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
    I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
    See Slim, shut up bitch, I'm tryna talk
    Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
    But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
    'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
    Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
    Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
    My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
    Got out of bed at all
    The morning rain clouds up my window (window)
    And I can't see at all
    And even if I could it'll all be gray
    But your picture on my wall
    It reminds me, that it's not so bad
    It's not so bad
    Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
    You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
    Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
    And here's an autograph for your brother
    I wrote it on a Starter cap
    I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
    Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
    But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
    I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
    You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
    To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
    And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
    That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
    I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
    Or maybe you just need to treat her better
    I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
    Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
    If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
    Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
    I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
    I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
    Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
    And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
    And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
    Come to think about, his name was, it was you
    Damn!`,

    title: 'Can I use a proxy on top of my Vercel Deployment?',
    author: { id: 'test1@gmail.com', name: '송승학' },
    tags: ['vercel', 'retrospective'],
    content: `It is possible to use an external proxy or load balancer to route requests to a Vercel Deployment. This article describes possible alternatives, downsides you need to be aware of, and general configuration.

    Using a Proxy
    Using a third party proxy (such as Cloudflare, Cloudfront, Akami or Fastly) with Vercel is not recommended and may cause unexpected downtime. If you decide to deploy your own proxy solution, it is critical that you are aware of the following complications and details:
    
    Global Distribution
    Vercel implements multiple technologies as part of our Edge Network to guarantee the performance and reachability of all hosted apps. It is important to understand that using your own proxy will affect the performance of your Deployment by introducing additional latency, especially if your proxy is not globally available.
    
    Vercel also ensures that when global Internet infrastructure problems occur, for example, a fiber cable is cut, we can deploy mitigation strategies automatically. An example is traffic re-routing: If a region is experiencing problems, we can redirect traffic to another location without action needed from your team.
    
    Reliability
    Using your own proxy can decrease the level of reliability since you are introducing a piece of infrastructure that Vercel does not manage. If a problem happens in your proxy that causes downtime, Vercel cannot deploy any mitigations and intervention by your team may be required.
    
    Cache Behavior
    A third party proxy, when used with Vercel, can introduce two caching layers: one at the third party and one at Vercel. This can result in incorrect data being sent to visitors.
    
    When you push a new Deployment to Vercel, our platform will purge the existing cache across all of our edge regions automatically. You will need to ensure that your proxy is also respecting this behaviour, and purging its own proxy cache after each deployment. Otherwise, your users may experience stale content, data chunking, mixed assets and other unexpected behaviour.
    
    Firewall and DoS Protection
    Vercel offers to all our customers a basic level of protection. If we detect an anomaly in requests coming from a single source, the IP can get banned for a period of time ranging from a few minutes to days.
    
    You must ensure that any traffic mitigation measures, such as DDoS protection, rate limiting or throttling are implemented within your third party proxy, to prevent this traffic from being subsequently routed to Vercel, resulting in your proxy IP addres(es) being blocked from accessing Vercel.
    
    For Enterprise customers, we may be able to tailor our solution and rulesets for you. If you are not yet an Enterprise customer but may benefit from this, please contact sales.
    
    Request Headers/Geolocation
    Vercel allows for custom routing based on user’s geolocation and IP addresses. Using a proxy will send all traffic via the proxy. This will result in incorrect geolocation data being presented and the public IP address of your proxy being sent. We do not support the x-forwarded-for header and therefore will not be able to read this information correctly.
    
    Domain Verification and Certificate Provisioning
    Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificates and checks to make sure that any custom domain are configured correctly. Using a proxy can impact this traffic. This may result in incorrect domain configuration alerts and prevent our Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates from being provisioned.
    
    To allow this traffic to pass correctly, you must ensure your proxy does not block or automatically redirect traffic on the following HTTP wildcard path:
    
    http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/.well-known/acme-challenge/*
    
    You must also ensure that the HOST header is correctly forwarded, otherwise the request will also fail. Certain proxy providers such as Cloudflare automatically configure these rules for you, but creating additional rules may block this. See here for how to configure Cloudflare with Vercel.
    
    Support
    Using a proxy introduces complications to your project or deployment that are unrelated to the Vercel platform and therefore we cannot recommend or provide support for issues when using a proxy. All Vercel projects get assigned a vercel.app domain which should be used for troubleshooting to identify and rule out any proxy related problems.
    
    Per our Support Terms, it may be necessary for the team to require you to disable or reconfigure your proxy before we can assist further.
    
    Conclusion
    Using a proxy with Vercel can cause unexpected issues for your website and every effort should be made to avoid using a proxy with Vercel.
    
    Implementing solutions such as Edge Functions, custom rate limiting and defining your cache control headers can achieve similar levels of performance and security when using Vercel.`,
